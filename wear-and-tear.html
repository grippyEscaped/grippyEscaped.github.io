        Having demonstrated its collision avoidance capabilities, Grippy embarked on its journey through the woods. 
        During the first half of the hike, it grew increasingly tired, its battery steadily depleting. 
        Furthermore, Grippy noticed its gripper becoming progressively looser. 
        "Damn," it thought, “here is nobody who could fix this for me”. 
        A few minutes later it happened, Grippy lost his gripper. It was devastated.

       Keep your eyes open at the next location, this is where Grippy last sent a signal. 
       Try to find its gripper there!
