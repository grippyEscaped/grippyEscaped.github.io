        Grippy was extremely exhausted and still hasn't resolved its energy issue since all houses were too far away. 
        There was no chance it could be saved at this point. In a very sad mood, 
        Grippy sat down at the beer garden at Kloster Andechs and thought about all the fun memories 
        it shared with the nice intrinsic people. Suddenly, Grippy saw some colleagues arriving and was beyond happy! 
        "They do care about me!", it thought happily. It never regretted having gone on a solo-trip from that point 
        on but Grippy was certain that this was the last such trip for a very long time.
    </p>
