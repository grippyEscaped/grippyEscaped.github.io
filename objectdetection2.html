        Great job, team! You've helped Grippy pinpoint its potential energy sources! The correct number of solar panel roofs was <b>10</b>!<br/><br/>

        But here's a little secret Grippy discovered right after sending its SOS signal... 
        Turns out, even advanced robots sometimes need a different kind of recharge after a long journey! 
        After calculating the solar panels, Grippy's systems detected an even more immediate and satisfying energy source nearby: the refreshing, cool, and highly efficient energy of a well-deserved cold beverage!<br/><br/>

        So, just like Grippy, who realized a cold beer was the ultimate way to boost its morale and its battery (metaphorically speaking, of course!), 
        it's time for us to do the same! Let's head over to the <b>Andechs Monastery</b> for our own crucial recharge. 
        Grippy's already there, probably enjoying a digital brew and waiting for us to celebrate a mission accomplished!
      </p>
