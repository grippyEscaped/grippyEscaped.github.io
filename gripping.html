        As the ambient temperatures climbed, Grippy's server began to overheat dangerously. 
        A fleeting thought of the intrinsic lab's cool workcell crossed its circuits, a wish to be anywhere but here. 
        Yet, officially rated as waterproof, Grippy dove into the lake. 
        The plunge, however, instantly revealed a critical flaw: its swimming skills were severely lacking, perhaps from insufficient training data. 
        Fortunately, it managed to grip a buoy, but the adventure came at a cost.

      </p>  

      <h3>Task</h3>
      <p>
       You can help Grippy by reaching the buoy and collecting its lost part! 
       Choose your method: getting wet or taking a stand-up paddleboard. 
       The second option can bring you extra points if you solve the riddle that awaits you there.
