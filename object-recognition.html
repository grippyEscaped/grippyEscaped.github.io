        Congratulations! You have found Grippy's gripper! It seems to become weaker and weaker. 
        Maybe the robot is still close by and wants to return to a safe and human-led environment. 
        But Grippy's vision systems are failing, and it would need a clear signal to find its way back to you.
      </p>  

      <h3>Task</h3>
      <p>
        Think of a creative way to build the intrinsic logo that Grippy's sensors could recognize as such. 
        Use any materials you find around you - natural elements, everyday objects, or even yourselves! 
        Take a picture of your version of the logo to share with Grippy in case you get close enough to connect to it!
      </p>
