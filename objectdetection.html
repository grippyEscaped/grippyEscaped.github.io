        Grippy had finally made it to the top of the monastery, the panoramic view of the valley stretching out before it. 
        But the long, arduous hike through the forest had come at a high price: its battery was critically low. 
        This was Grippy's worst-case scenario‚Äîbeing lost and alone, far from its intrinsic friends who would never find it here. 
        (Of course, it didn't know that a huge search party had already started hours ago, their signals cutting through the undergrowth.)
        <br/><b>Get to the top and find its viewpoint!</b><br/>

        Desperate, Grippy began to scan the valley below, its optical sensors zooming in on every detail. 
        It was searching for the most efficient way to recharge: green energy sources. 
        Grippy's advanced systems weren't just idly scanning; they were performing a precise calculation, 
        meticulously counting all the solar panel roofs that represented its best hope for a desperate recharge.
      </p>  

      <h3>Task</h3>
      <p>
       Determine Grippy's exact count of roofs with solar panels!
       <b>Tell it to the group leader.</b>
