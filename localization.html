      Gripy's Localization Quandary ! üó∫Ô∏èüß≠Ô∏è

      <p>
        Grippy methodically hiked through Herrsching, its sensors processing the charming Bavarian town. 
        The warm sun illuminated picturesque streets and blooming flower boxes. 
        Grippy wasn't just observing; its high-resolution cameras actively gathered data, creating a vast digital mosaic of Herrsching's visual landscape. 
        These images, from cobblestone patterns to vibrant geraniums, were vital for its evolving visual recognition system. 
        Grippy's purpose was to learn and refine its ability to interpret complex visual information, enhancing its navigation and interaction with the physical world.

      <h3>Task</h3>
      <p>
       To help us predict its destination, perhaps we can retrace its journey. 
       Identify the image's location to aid in our robot's recovery. 
       There you will find a QR-code that will lead you to the next task.
       If you don't find it, ask your guide for a hint (but it costs a small malus).
